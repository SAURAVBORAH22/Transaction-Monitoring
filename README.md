# Transaction Monitoring - An Anti-Money Laundering System

## Problem

Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions. The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2 - 5% of global GDP, or $800 billion - $2 trillion in current US dollars. It calls for more equipped monitoring system to monitor transactions. 

Anti-money laundering (AML) transaction monitoring software allows banks and other financial institutions to monitor customer transactions on a daily basis or in real-time for risk. Our solution will automate the whole process of detecting a suspected money laundering case.

## Implementation:

1. Identification of the dataset.
2. Cleaning the dataset to remove redundant data.
3. Training the Machine Learning model and building a rule based algorithm.
4. A system created by integrating both the Rule Based System and Machine Learning, will flag the transactions into different categories.
5. Potential fraudulent transactions will be identified.
6. Whole backend will be integrated with a fontend platform.
7. User can upload the data of daily transactions and can get potential fraudulent transactions.
8. A notification system will be integrated as well which will notify the person via email whose transactions are flagged as money laundering case.
