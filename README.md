# Transaction Monitoring - An Anti-Money Laundering System

## Problem
Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions. The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2 - 5% of global GDP, or $800 billion - $2 trillion in current US dollars. It calls for more equipped monitoring system to monitor transactions.
